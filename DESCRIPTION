Description: The vccp package implements the Vine Copula Change Point (VCCP)
    methodology for the estimation of the number and location of multiple
    change points in the network structure of multivariate time series. The
    method uses vine copulas and adapted binary segmentation algorithm to 
    identify multiple change points and a likelihood ratio test for inference.
    The vine copulas allow for various forms of dependence between time series
    including tail, symmetric and asymmetric dependence. The functions have been
    extensively tested on simulated multivariate time series data and fMRI data.
    For details on the VCCP methodology, please see Xiong & Cribben (2021).
