Description: Use Vine Copula Change Points (VCCP) model to estimate the number and location of multiple 
    change points in th functional connectivity structure of multivariate 
    time series. Possible binary segmentation methods of the VCCP model
    include NBS, OBS, MOSUM, and WBS. You can also check the 
    significance of detected candidates by Stationary Bootstrap or 
    Vuong test method.
